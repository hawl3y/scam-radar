# Scam Radar

A mobile-friendly web app (PWA) where neighbors report and confirm local scams. See `PROJECT_BRIEF.md` for scope.

Stack: Next.js 16 (App Router, TypeScript), Tailwind CSS, Supabase (Postgres + PostGIS + pgvector, Auth), Vercel.

## Local setup (macOS)

1. **Node:** install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), then from the repo root:
   ```sh
   nvm install   # reads .nvmrc (Node 24)
   nvm use
   ```
2. **Supabase CLI:**
   ```sh
   brew install supabase/tap/supabase
   supabase login
   ```
3. **Dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Environment:**
   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env.local
   ```
   Fill in the **dev** project's URL, publishable key, and secret key (Supabase Dashboard → Project Settings → API Keys). Set `RATE_LIMIT_SALT`, `CRON_SECRET`, and `EMAIL_TOKEN_SECRET` to random strings (`openssl rand -hex 32`), and add a `RESEND_API_KEY` (see [Alerts](#alerts-email)).
5. **Database:** link the dev project and apply migrations:
   ```sh
   supabase link --project-ref <dev-project-ref>
   supabase db push
   ```
6. **Run:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open http://localhost:3000.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Dev server |
| `npm run build` | Production build |
| `npm run lint` | ESLint |
| `npm run typecheck` | Generate route types and run `tsc` |
| `npm test` | Unit tests (Vitest) |

## Supabase projects

Two hosted projects: `scam-radar-dev` and `scam-radar-prod`. No local Docker database.

Zip code centers (`zip_centroids`) come from the US Census Bureau [Gazetteer files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html) (2025 ZCTA, public domain) and are loaded by a migration.

### Matching (clusters and Check)
Text similarity uses Postgres `pg_trgm` behind database functions (`nearest_cluster_candidate`, `match_clusters`). Thresholds live in `src/lib/matching.ts`. To re-tune them, run `node scripts/calibrate-matching.mts` (read-only, uses the linked dev project) and update the numbers and the comment there.

Don't use `supabase migration new` from a script or agent; it waits for SQL on stdin. Create `supabase/migrations/<YYYYMMDDHHMMSS>_<name>.sql` by hand instead.

### Database changes
Only through migrations:
```sh
supabase migration new <name>      # creates supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_<name>.sql
supabase db push                   # applies to the currently linked project
```
Keep the CLI linked to **dev**. Prod gets migrations automatically from the `Migrate prod database` workflow when they merge to `main`. Never push to prod by hand.

Migrations must work with the code already in production (add columns/tables; rename or drop only in a later change), because the prod migration and the Vercel production deploy run at the same time.

### Auth settings (do this in each project's dashboard)
- **Authentication → Sign In / Providers → Email:** enabled. Leave "Confirm email" on.
- **Authentication → URL Configuration:**
  - Site URL: `http://localhost:3000` (dev) or `https://scam-radar.joechawley.com` (prod).
  - Redirect URLs:
    - dev: `http://localhost:3000/**` and `https://scam-radar-*-hawleys-projects.vercel.app/**` (preview deploys)
    - prod: `https://scam-radar.joechawley.com/**`
- **Authentication → Emails → SMTP Settings:** custom SMTP via [Resend](https://resend.com).
  - Host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, username `resend`, password: a Resend API key.
  - Sender: `no-reply@scam-radar.joechawley.com` (domain verified in Resend).
- **Authentication → Emails → Templates:** paste `supabase/templates/sign-in.html` into both **Magic Link** and **Confirm signup** (subject: `Your Scam Radar sign-in link`). Custom templates require custom SMTP.

The email has a link (to `/auth/confirm?token_hash=…`, works in any browser) and a sign-in code. The code is for people using the app from their iPhone home screen, which doesn't share sign-ins with Safari. The code entry is controlled by `SIGN_IN_CODE_ENABLED` in `src/app/login/login-form.tsx`; it must stay in sync with the template.

## Deploys (Vercel)

- Import the GitHub repo in Vercel (framework: Next.js; defaults are fine).
- Environment variables (Project Settings → Environment Variables):
  - **Production:** prod project's `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://scam-radar.joechawley.com`; plus its own `RATE_LIMIT_SALT`, `CRON_SECRET`, `EMAIL_TOKEN_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, and `FTC_API_KEY`
  - **Preview:** the dev project's values; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://scam-radar-git-<branch>-hawleys-projects.vercel.app` is fine for testing (links in preview emails need Vercel sign-in); different random secrets
  - Mark every secret (`SUPABASE_SECRET_KEY`, `RATE_LIMIT_SALT`, `CRON_SECRET`, `EMAIL_TOKEN_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `FTC_API_KEY`) as **Sensitive**.
- Every branch push gets a preview deploy; `main` deploys to production at https://scam-radar.joechawley.com (DNS: CNAME at DreamHost).
- Preview deploys are behind Vercel Authentication (Deployment Protection). Sign in to Vercel to view them, including on a phone.

## Alerts (email)

- **Sending:** [Resend](https://resend.com) API, from `alerts@scam-radar.joechawley.com`. Create an API key with **Sending access** for the domain; use separate keys for Preview and Production. SPF and DKIM come from the Resend domain verification; DMARC is a TXT record at DreamHost (`_dmarc.scam-radar`, `v=DMARC1; p=none;`).
- **Instant alerts:** sent right after a report or "I got this too" pushes a cluster to `ALERT_INSTANT_THRESHOLD` (default 3), to users in **instant** mode within their radius. Max 3 per person per day.
- **Daily digest:** Vercel Cron calls `/api/cron/digest` at 12:00 UTC (8 am Eastern in summer, 7 am in winter). Crons only run on production. To run it on a preview:
  ```sh
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://<preview-url>/api/cron/digest
  ```
  Previews are behind Vercel Authentication, so run that from a browser session or add a [protection bypass](https://vercel.com/docs/deployment-protection/methods-to-bypass-deployment-protection) header. Re-running sends nothing new: one digest per person per Eastern day.
- **No duplicates:** each email is recorded in `alerts_sent` before it's sent and released if sending fails.
- **Unsubscribe:** every email has one-click unsubscribe headers and a signed link to `/email-preferences` that works without signing in.

## Trust and safety

- **Admin access:** `/admin` is owner-only. Add yourself once per Supabase project (dev and prod) in **SQL Editor**:
  ```sql
  insert into public.admins (user_id)
  select id from auth.users where email = '<your email>';
  ```
  Admins get an email when a report is flagged. Don't commit admin emails to the repo.
- **Flags:** 3 open flags from accounts in good standing auto-hide a report until an admin removes it or dismisses the flags.
- **Reputation:** computed live by `public.reputation()` (formula in the migration `*_trust_and_safety.sql`). Accounts below −2 are limited: their reports and "got this too" are hidden from others and don't count toward alerts. Newer accounts (below 3) count half toward the instant-alert threshold.
- **Rate limits:** in `src/lib/rate-limits.ts`. `node scripts/check-rate-limit.mts` verifies the database limiter on the linked dev project.
- **Account deletion:** Settings → Delete my account removes the user and cascades to their reports, corroborations, ratings, flags, and alert history.
- **Legal pages:** `/terms`, `/privacy`, `/rules`. The contact address is `SUPPORT_EMAIL` in `src/lib/site.ts`. Update `/privacy` whenever data collection or service providers change.

## Unwanted-call trends (public data)

- **Sources:** FTC Do Not Call complaints API (`api.ftc.gov/v0/dnc-complaints`, needs `FTC_API_KEY` from [api.data.gov](https://api.data.gov/signup)) and the FBI IC3 announcements feed (`ic3.gov/PSA/RSS`, filtered to scam/fraud items). FTC content is public domain; show attribution and never imply endorsement. **BBB Scam Tracker is link-only**: its terms prohibit aggregation.
- **Privacy:** only daily counts are stored: per market area code and subject (`dnc_daily_counts`) and per state and subject (`dnc_state_daily_counts`). Phone numbers and cities from the FTC data are dropped during ingestion.
- **What the data means:** the complainant's state and their phone's area code, not where the caller is or the viewer's town. Labels say "reported in New Jersey (201 and 551 area codes)", never "near you". Complaints with no state listed (about 1 in 7) are excluded.
- **What a visitor sees:** their market (same state as their zip **and** within the market's radius) if it has data; otherwise their state's trends; otherwise "No local trend data for your area yet" plus national FBI headlines. Zip states come from the Census ZCTA-to-county file (`zip_centroids.state`).
- **Ingestion schedule:** GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ingest.yml`) calls `/api/cron/ingest` on prod **every 15 minutes, 17:00–20:45 UTC, Monday–Friday** (after the FTC's weekday update, ~noon Eastern). Vercel Cron also calls it daily at 18:00 UTC as a backup. Each run skips market days and states fetched in the last 6 hours (days with zero complaints are re-checked, since zero usually means "not published yet"), so repeat runs are cheap. The workflow needs the repo secret `PROD_CRON_SECRET` (the prod `CRON_SECRET`). Run it by hand from GitHub → Actions → **Ingest FTC data** → Run workflow, or with curl:
  ```sh
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://<url>/api/cron/ingest
  ```
  - **Markets:** area code + date queries (the API supports both together), limited to complaints from the market's state. Fills missing days in the last 14 and re-fetches the last 3.
  - **States:** the API ignores date filters when filtering by state, so each state is read newest-first, 3 days deep, every run. There is no backfill beyond that; state trends say "N days of data so far" until a week is collected, and week-over-week comparisons appear after two weeks.
  - **Rate limits:** besides the key's hourly quota (20,000), a stricter burst throttle sits in front of the API. It appears to be per IP (Vercel shares IPs), rejects rapid requests with a 429 that reports "remaining 0", and takes ~10 minutes to recover; retrying sooner doesn't help. So requests go one at a time, paced (~400 ms apart), within a 4-minute run budget: market area codes first (newest day for every code before any backfill), then market states, then the other states in a daily rotation. On a 429 the run stops and keeps every fully read day; the next scheduled run continues. Ingest runs email admins only on real errors. A daily coverage check (in the digest cron, Tue–Sat) emails if any market area code or more than 12 states weren't fetched in the last day.
  - **Actions minutes:** the repo is public, so GitHub-hosted runners are free. If it went private, the worst case is 16 runs × ~22 weekdays × 5 billed minutes = 1,760 minutes/month (runs that skip finish in under a minute), within the Free plan's 2,000.
- **Markets:** areas with area-code trends live in the `markets` table (state, area codes, center zip, radius, police contact). The center zip must be in the market's state. Add or change them in Supabase **SQL Editor**; no code change or deploy needed, and the next ingest picks up new area codes:
  ```sql
  insert into public.markets (name, state, area_codes, center_zip, radius_miles)
  values ('NY 914', 'NY', '{914}', '10601', 25);

  -- Police contact shown on /next-steps (null = "your local police non-emergency line"):
  update public.markets set police_contact = 'the Town Police non-emergency line at (555) 555-0100' where name = 'NY 845';
  ```

## Pilot (Phase 6)

See [PILOT.md](PILOT.md) for the launch checklist, weekly routine, and success criteria. Metrics are first-party only: aggregate daily counts (`usage_daily`) and signed-in activity days (`user_activity_days`), shown at `/admin/metrics` and emailed to admins on Mondays. Alert emails stop at `EMAIL_DAILY_BUDGET` per day (default 90). The printable flyer is at `/flyer`.

## Making changes

1. Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b <feature>`.
2. If the change includes a migration, apply it to dev: `supabase db push` (CLI linked to dev).
3. Push the branch and open a pull request. This runs:
   - **CI** (GitHub Actions): lint, typecheck, unit tests.
   - **Vercel preview** using the dev database.
4. Test on the preview. When CI is green, merge the PR.
5. Merging to `main`:
   - Vercel deploys production.
   - If `supabase/migrations/` changed, the **Migrate prod database** workflow applies them to prod. Check it passed under the repo's **Actions** tab.

### One-time GitHub setup
- **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret:**
  - `SUPABASE_PROD_DB_URL`: prod project → **Connect** → **Session pooler** connection string (port `5432`), with `[YOUR-PASSWORD]` replaced by the prod database password. Percent-encode special characters in the password (e.g. `@` → `%40`, `#` → `%23`, `/` → `%2F`). Don't use the direct connection string; GitHub runners can't reach it (IPv6 only).
- **Settings → General → Pull Requests:** turn on **Automatically delete head branches**.
- **Settings → Rules → Rulesets → New branch ruleset** for `main`:
  - Require a pull request before merging.
  - Require status checks to pass: `checks`.
  - Block force pushes.
